    "A: If we left stopwords which include conjunctions, prepositions, articles, pronouns, and auxiliary verbs, the result will generate less meaningful words, because there would be possibilities that these stopwords would be most dominant. It could skew the results since it emphasizes frequent words that don't add much insight into the text’s content. On the otherhands, removing stopwords allows the analysis to get more significant and content-rich words. This often leads to a list of top words that better reflect the core themes and topics of the text. By excluding stopwords, it would enhance the relevance and accuracy of text analysis. The final result will highlight words that contribute more meaningfully to understanding the text. \n",

    "A: Lexical diversity refers to the variety of unique words used in a text or speech. It reflects the richness of the vocabulary in the lyrics. I was under impression that most of artists use similar range of vocabulary in their lyrics as long as their songs express similar themes regardless the genre. After analyzing the artists' lyrics, I found that their lexical diversity was similar; which would support the belief that artists generally have a comparable vocabulary range. However, an interesting finding would suggest that factors such as genre or lyrical approach would play a more substantial role. These differences would challenge my prior assumption and highlight how artistic style impacts language or words use. For example, an artist who sings a love theme for hiphop or rap genre, the lyrics might contain more explicit languages compare to country or pop genre. If we include specific stopword based genre themes, the results confirm that lexical diversity is consistent across artists based on the themes. Thus, the analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between lyrical content and lexical diversity.\n",
